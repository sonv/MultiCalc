In-class worksheets. Active Calculus: Multivariable by Schlicker et al. 2018 edition. (https://activecalculus.org/multi/preface-2.html) Thomas’ Calculus: Early Transcendentals by Hass, Heil, et al. \\(14^{th}\\) edition. Calculus Early Transcendental by Stewart. \\(8^{th}\\) edition. Anything you can find on Google would work. Calculus is a subject that people have written about so much. So, there’s no excuse for not having access to the knowledge. Course description How do we describe the trajectory of a space shuttle? How is the human body affected by scuba diving to different depths for different lengths of time? The mathematics required to describe most real life systems involves functions of more than one variable. The concepts of the derivative and integral from a first course in calculus must therefore be extended to higher dimensional settings. In this course students will be guided through the essential ideas of multivariable calculus, including partial derivatives, multiple integrals and vector calculus, and their applications. These mathematical tools are used extensively in the physical sciences and engineering, and in other areas including economics and computer graphics. Learning objectives After the course, students are expected to: Be confident in handling functions of two or more variables and familiar with how they can be represented graphically Understand the key concepts of multivariable calculus, including partial derivatives, the gradient vector, multiple integrals, line and surface integrals, the divergence and curl of a vector function Know how such derivatives and integrals are calculated and some of their uses Be able to apply these ideas to real world problems Have improved analytic, computational and problem solving skills Assessment During the course, students are expected to compute their own percentage points based on the following scheme. The instructor is not responsible for providing the running percentage. Form of assessment Weight Weekly homeworks 25% Class worksheets 15% Mini-project 15% Midterm 15% Final 30% The following is the non-negotiable letter grade breakdown. It is based on common practice in the United States for standard courses such as Calculus.

Work more than 2 days late will not be accepted. Except for exceptional circumstances (see definition), I will not extend the deadlines. Time expectations Some materials require time to be accustomed to. Some students are quicker than others. However, on average, you should expect 10-15 hours per week (including class time) on the materials in order to know the subject relatively well. Collaboration &amp; Plagiarism Plagiarism is the act of submitting the intellectual property of another person as your own. It is one of the most serious of academic offences. Acts of plagiarism include, but are not limited to: - Copying all or a part of another person’s work and presenting it as your own, or not giving proper credit. - Purchasing a paper from someone (or a website) and presenting it as your own work. - Re-submitting your work from one course to fulfill a requirement in another course. Olin College’s Rob Martello says: “You must always take extreme care to acknowledge the source of all quotes, content, and theories. Even if you paraphrase the information, you need to cite all sources that informed your analysis. Citations must include page numbers, website addresses, times of interviews, or other details as needed. When in doubt, cite.” Further details can be found in the Code of Academic Integrity. Learning Support In addition to your course instructors, there are other resources available to support your academic work at Fulbright, including one-on-one consultations with learning support staff, supplementary workshops, and both individual and group tutoring and mentoring in course content, language learning, and academic skills. If you would like to request learning support, please contact Fulbright Learning Support (https://learning-support.notion.site). Wellbeing Mental health and wellbeing are essential for the success of your academic journey. The Fulbright Wellness Center provides various services including counseling, safer community, and accessibility services. If you are experiencing undue personal or academic stress, are feeling unsafe, or would like to know more about issues related to wellbeing, please contact the Wellness Center via wellness@fulbright.edu.vn or visit the Wellness Center office on Level 5 of the Crescent campus.
