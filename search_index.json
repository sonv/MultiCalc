Anything you can find on Google would work. Calculus is a subject that people have written about so much. So, there’s no excuse for not having access to the knowledge. 3-D grapher: https://www.math3d.org/ Course description How do we describe the trajectory of a space shuttle? How is the human body affected by scuba diving to different depths for different lengths of time? The mathematics required to describe most real life systems involves functions of more than one variable. The concepts of the derivative and integral from a first course in calculus must therefore be extended to higher dimensional settings. In this course students will be guided through the essential ideas of multivariable calculus, including partial derivatives, multiple integrals and vector calculus, and their applications. These mathematical tools are used extensively in the physical sciences and engineering, and in other areas including economics and computer graphics. Learning objectives After the course, students are expected to: Be confident in handling functions of two or more variables and familiar with how they can be represented graphically Understand the key concepts of multivariable calculus, including partial derivatives, the gradient vector, multiple integrals, line and surface integrals, the divergence and curl of a vector function Know how such derivatives and integrals are calculated and some of their uses Be able to apply these ideas to real world problems Have improved analytic, computational and problem solving skills Assessment During the course, students are expected to compute their own percentage points based on the following scheme. The instructor is not responsible for providing the running percentage.

Work more than 2 days late will not be accepted. Except for exceptional circumstances (see definition), I will not extend the deadlines. Time expectations Some materials require time to be accustomed to. Some students are quicker than others. However, on average, you should expect 10-15 hours per week (including class time) on the materials in order to know the subject relatively well. Collaboration &amp; Plagiarism Plagiarism is the act of submitting the intellectual property of another person as your own. It is one of the most serious of academic offenses. Acts of plagiarism include, but are not limited to: Copying, or allowing someone to copy, all or a part of another person’s work and presenting it as your own, or not giving proper credit. Purchasing a paper from someone (or a website) and presenting it as your own work. Re-submitting your work from another course to fulfill a requirement in another course.

What does it mean for two vectors to be equal? How do we add two vectors together and multiply a vector by a scalar? How do we determine the magnitude of a vector? What is a unit vector How do we find a unit vector in the direction of a given vector? Typically, we talk about 3-dimensional vectors (as discussed in Stewart and Thomas). However, since talking about \\(n\\)-dimensional vectors doesn’t require much more effort, we will talk about \\(n\\)-dimensional vectors instead. Definition 1.1 An \\(n\\)-dimensional Euclidean space \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is the Cartesian product of \\(n\\) Euclidean spaces \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). Definition 1.2 An \\(n\\)-dimensional vector \\(\\textbf{v}\\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) is a tuple \\[\\begin{equation} \\textbf{v} = \\langle v_1,\\dots, v_n \\rangle \\,, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(v_i \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). In dimensions less than or equal to 3, we represent a vector geometrically by an arrow, whose length represents the magnitude. Remark. A point in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is also represented by an \\(n\\)-tuple but with round brackets. A vector connecting two points \\(A= (a_1, \\dots, a_n)\\) and \\(B=(b_1, \\dots, b_n)\\) can be constructed as \\[\\begin{equation*} \\textbf{x} = \\langle b_1-a_1, \\dots, b_n - a_n \\rangle \\,. \\end{equation*}\\] We denote the above vector as \\(\\vec{AB}\\) where \\(A\\) is the tail (initial point) and \\(B\\) is the tip/head (terminal point). We denote \\(\\textbf{0}\\) to be the zero vector, i.e., \\[\\begin{equation*} \\textbf{0} = \\langle 0, \\dots, 0 \\rangle \\,. \\end{equation*}\\] Definition 1.3 The length of a vector \\(\\textbf{v}\\) (denoted by \\(| \\textbf{v}|\\)) is defined to be \\[\\begin{equation} |\\textbf{v}| = \\sqrt{ v_1^2 + \\dots + v_n^2} \\,. \\end{equation}\\] Definition 1.4 A unit vector is a vector that has magnitude 1. Exercise 1.1 Turn a vector \\(\\textbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) into a unit vector with the same direction. Rules to manipulate vectors Let \\(\\textbf{a}, \\textbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\) and \\(c,d \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). Then, \\[\\begin{equation*} c( \\textbf{a} + \\textbf{b}) = \\langle c a_1 + c b_1, \\dots, c a_n + c b_n \\rangle = c\\textbf{a} + c\\textbf{b} \\,, \\end{equation*}\\] and \\[\\begin{equation*} (c+d) \\textbf{a} = c\\mathbf{a} + d\\mathbf{a} \\,. \\end{equation*}\\] These formulas are deceptively simple. Make sure you understand all the implications. Because of this rule, sometimes it is good to write vectors in terms of elementary vectors: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{u} = u_1 \\mathbf{e_1} + \\dots + u_n \\mathbf{e_n} \\,, \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(e_i = \\langle 0,\\dots, 1, \\dots, 0\\rangle\\) is the vector which has zero at all entries except that the \\(i^{th}\\) entry is 1. In 3D, \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{e_1} = \\mathbf{i} \\,, \\qquad \\mathbf{e_2} = \\mathbf{j} \\,, \\qquad \\mathbf{e_3} = \\mathbf{k} \\,. \\end{equation*}\\] Properties of vector operations Read the book (Make sure you understand the geometric intepretation) 1.2 Products 1.2.1 Dot product How is the dot product of two vectors defined and what geometric information does it tell us? How can we tell if two vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) are perpendicular? How do we find the projection of one vector onto another? Definition 1.5 The dot product of vectors \\(\\textbf{u} = \\langle u_1, \\dots, u_n \\rangle\\) and \\(\\textbf{v} = \\langle v_1, \\dots, v_n \\rangle\\) in \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) is the scalar \\[\\begin{equation*} \\textbf{u} \\cdot \\textbf{v} = u_1 v_1 +\\dots + u_n v_n \\,. \\end{equation*}\\] Properties of dot product Let \\(\\textbf{u}, \\textbf{v}, \\textbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\). Then, \\(\\textbf{u}\\cdot \\textbf{v} = \\textbf{v}\\cdot \\textbf{u}\\), \\((\\textbf{u} + \\textbf{v})\\cdot \\textbf{w} = (\\textbf{u}\\cdot \\textbf{w}) + (\\textbf{v}\\cdot \\textbf{w})\\), If \\(c\\) is a scalar, then \\((c \\textbf{u})\\cdot \\textbf{w} = c (\\textbf{u}\\cdot \\textbf{w})\\). Theorem 1.1 (Law of cosine) If \\(\\theta\\) is the angle between the vectors \\(\\textbf{u}\\) and \\(\\textbf{v}\\), then \\[\\begin{equation*} \\textbf{u}\\cdot \\textbf{v} = |\\textbf{u}|| \\textbf{v}| \\cos \\theta \\,. \\end{equation*}\\] Exercise 1.2 Prove this theorem in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\). Corollary 1.1 Two vectors \\(\\textbf{u}\\) and \\(\\textbf{v}\\) are orthogonal to each other if \\(\\textbf{u} \\cdot \\textbf{v} = 0\\). Projection Let \\(\\textbf{u}, \\textbf{v}\\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\). The component of \\(\\textbf{u}\\) in the direction of \\(\\textbf{v}\\) is the scalar \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathrm{comp}_{\\mathbf{v}}\\mathbf{u} = \\frac{\\mathbf{u}\\cdot \\mathbf{v}}{|\\mathbf{v}|} \\,, \\end{equation*}\\] and the projection of \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) onto \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the vector \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathrm{proj}_{\\mathbf{v}}\\mathbf{u} =\\left( \\mathbf{u}\\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{|\\mathbf{v}|}\\right) \\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{|\\mathbf{v}|} = \\frac{\\mathbf{u}\\cdot \\mathbf{v}}{\\mathbf{v} \\cdot\\mathbf{v}} \\mathbf{v} \\,. \\end{equation*}\\] Read the book for more details. Make sure you understand the geometric meaning. 1.2.2 3D special: Cross product This concept is very specific to \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). It will not make sense in other dimensions. Definition 1.6 Let \\(\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\). The cross product of \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is defined to be \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v} = \\langle u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2, u_3v_1 - u_1 v_3, u_1v_2 - u_2v_1 \\rangle \\,. \\end{equation*}\\] Exercise 1.3 Write down a few other representations of the definition of the cross product. Properties of cross product Let \\(\\mathbf{u}, \\mathbf{v}, \\mathbf{w}\\) be vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) and \\(c\\in \\mathbb{R}\\). Then (anti-symmetry) \\(\\mathbf{u}\\times \\mathbf{v} = - \\mathbf{v}\\times \\mathbf{u}\\) \\((\\mathbf{u} + \\mathbf{v})\\times \\mathbf{w} = (\\mathbf{u}\\times \\mathbf{w}) + (\\mathbf{v}\\times \\mathbf{w})\\) \\((c \\mathbf{u})\\times \\mathbf{w} = c(\\mathbf{u}\\times \\mathbf{w}) = \\mathbf{u}\\times (c\\mathbf{w})\\) \\(\\mathbf{u}\\times \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}\\) if \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) are parallel WARNING: in general \\((\\mathbf{u}\\times \\mathbf{v})\\times \\mathbf{w} \\not = \\mathbf{u}\\times (\\mathbf{v}\\times \\mathbf{w})\\) Theorem 1.2 Let \\(\\theta\\) be the angle between \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\). Then, \\[\\begin{equation*} | \\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} | = |\\mathbf{a}||\\mathbf{b}| \\sin\\theta \\,. \\end{equation*}\\] Theorem 1.3 The vector \\(\\mathbf{a}\\times \\mathbf{b}\\) is orthogonal to both \\(\\mathbf{a}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}\\). Corollary 1.2 Let \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) be vectors in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\). \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{u}\\cdot (\\mathbf{u}\\times \\mathbf{v}) = 0 \\,. \\end{equation*}\\] Theorem 1.4 The length, \\(|\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{v}|\\), of the cross product of vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\) is the area of the parallelogram determined by \\(\\mathbf{u}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v}\\).
