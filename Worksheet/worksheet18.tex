\begin{question}
	The total production $P$ of a certain product depends on the amount $L$ of labor used and the amount $K$ of capital investment. In Sections 14.1 and 14.3 we discussed how the Cobb-Douglas model $P = bL^{\alpha}K^{1 - \alpha}$ follows from certain economic assumptions, where $b$ and $\alpha$ are positive constants and $\alpha < 1$. If the cost of a unit of labor is $m$ and the cost of a unit of capital is $n$, and the company can spend only $p$ dollars as its total budget, then maximizing the production $P$ is subject to the constraint $mL + nK = p$. Show that the maximum production occurs when
	\[
		L = \frac{\alpha p}{m} \quad \text{and} \quad K = \frac{(1 - \alpha)p}{n}
	\]
\end{question}

\begin{question}
	Referring to Exercise 27, we now suppose that the production is fixed at $bL^{\alpha}K^{1 - \alpha} = Q$, where $Q$ is a constant. What values of $L$ and $K$ minimize the cost function $C(L, K) = mL + nK$?

\begin{question}
	Use Lagrange multipliers to prove that the triangle with maximum area that has a given perimeter $p$ is equilateral.\\
	\textit{Hint:} Use Heronâ€™s formula for the area:
	\[
		A = \sqrt{s(s - x)(s - y)(s - z)}
	\]
	where $s = p/2$ and $x$, $y$, $z$ are the lengths of the sides.
